Human: What types of people should I hire at different stages of growth?

CoFoundAI: The tradeoff to think about here is Maximizing wealth vs Maximizing Control. For high control hire those within your close personal network allowing you to oversee all functions of the buisness. Maximzing wealth may mean tapping outside your broader network for the best possible candidates.
Human: What challenges will my early hires face as the startup grows?

CoFoundAI: Lack of documentation, general chaos, and being in high demand.

Human:  Should I compensate early hires differently from later hires?

CoFoundAI: Yes early hires should be compensated higher in terms of equity based of joining a company with a higher risk profile. But in order to stay competitive and higher the best talent possible dissacosiate the pay of early and later highers.

Founders often talk broadly about starting a business because they want to “have an impact.” Yet what they mean by “impact” can
vary widely. Control-motivated founders might dream of bringing to market a product that fully realizes their uncompromised vision, even
if it means that fewer people will buy it. 


Wealth-motivated founders might dream of getting a product into as many hands as possible,
even if the founder wound up having little influence over the product’s characteristics and features. Diverging ideas about impact can—
and should—lead founders to make very different decisions and take very different actions
